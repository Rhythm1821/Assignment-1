#    String   - Strings are a part of data types which are used to define the values of a variable.
#    Variable - Variables are used to assign values to certain elements so that they can be further used to write code efficiently and can be understood in an easy manner.

#     contains three types:
#         int     - Contains numeric values without decimal 
#         float   - Contains numeric values with dacimals
#         complex - Contains numeric values with complex numbers

#   Boolean data type - Contains values with true or false

#   Dictionary - Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.
#               Example-: a = {"name": "Sam" , "age": 12}

# Ans-4 An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is interpreted to produce some other value


# Ans-5 A statement is used for creating and declaring variables while an expression is used for evaluating results
#   Example-: x = 10      (A statement)
#             x = x + 10  (An expression)
